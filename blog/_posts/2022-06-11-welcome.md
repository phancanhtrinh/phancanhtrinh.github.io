Welcome. I decide to move my blog to Jekyll. I spent a whole day just solving issues on Github, but finally, it worked. I will use this site to share my journey in science. I hope it will be helpful for people who want to learn from an amateur guy like me.

As you know, I am a Pharmacist but an IT lover, which motivated me to get a bachelor's degree in IT. I love bioinformatics, but I dive into a wet lab where I find the truth of nature.
