I am incredibly grateful to ESCMID - European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases for recognizing my work and including me in this list. It is truly an honor to be among such accomplished individuals. As a young scientist, this recognition inspires me to keep pushing the boundaries of my research and strive for excellence.
