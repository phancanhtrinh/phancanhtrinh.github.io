Thrilled to share some fantastic news! I am incredibly honored and grateful to be the recipient of the esteemed Bernd Rode Award 2024, presented by ASEA-UNINET. I owe immense gratitude to *Prof. Karl Kuchler* for his invaluable guidance and mentoring, which has been instrumental in my success. I extend my heartfelt thanks to *Prof. Adelheid Elbe-BÃ¼rger*, all collaborators, the lab members (current and former), and the Tissue Home PhD Program members for their support and encouragement throughout my journey. This achievement would not have been possible without their incredible support and collaboration.
