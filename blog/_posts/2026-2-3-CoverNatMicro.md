🎉🎉🎉 I still can’t believe this is real. I got the cover of the February issue of Nature Microbiology — what an honor. This feels especially wonderful right before the Lunar New Year holiday.

This year was challenging in many ways, but incredibly fruitful for our family. Both of my parents’ "kids" graduated—my dear sister and me. My sister became valedictorian in dental school and also ranked top 1 in the residency entrance exam.

We are deeply grateful for this journey. We will keep working hard, stay motivated, and move forward into the future.
