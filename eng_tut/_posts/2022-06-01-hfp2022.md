I joined the very first conference in this field. Spending the whole week with around 150 "fungal" scientists in France, I learned so much from them. I got some valuable ideas for my research. 
I highly recommend FEBS Advanced Lecturer Course for people working in Biochemistry.
Hope to meet all of you again in HFP2024!
