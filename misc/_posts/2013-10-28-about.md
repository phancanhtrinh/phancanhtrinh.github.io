## Purpose

This website was built as my personal portfolio and blog. I try to switch from WordPress to Jekyll for a faster website. I still write the tips and tutorials on scientific skills that I accumulate during my studying journey. Hope they are helpful for some people who are starting their science careers. 

## Source code

Source codes are adapted from the Bedford lab ([bedford.io](http://bedford.io)).  

### Build

The site is built by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
