# Abstract

*Acinetobacter baumannii* is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infection in Vietnam. Of note, antibiotic resistance genes are significantly popular in clinical isolates of *A. baumannii*. Therefore, rapid identification of *A. baumannii* and determination of antibiotic resistance genes will help to make effective clinical decisions related to antibiotic use. This paper proposes a multiplex PCR to identify *Acinetobacter baumannii* and detect their ß-lactam antibiotic resistance genes in clinical isolates. Multiplex PCR was applied to amplified recA gene and region ITS 16S - 23S rDNA for Rapid detection of *A. baumannii*. The two antibiotic resistance genes - blaOXA-51-like, ampC gene - were detected by multiplex PCR and three genes coding Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV genes - were subjected to PCR. 49 bacteria strains were subjected to colony PCR. The result showed that 46 strains were *A. baumannii* and 3 strains belonged to the genus *Acinetobacter*. The multiplex PCR showed that all of 46 *A. baumannii* containing the blaOXA-51-like gene and the AmpC gene; 34 strains possess the gene blaTEM and none of them has blaCTX-M and blaSHV genes. The results of the multiplex PCR are the same as those of the in vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing of *A. baumannii*. However, applying the multiplex PCR directly from the bacteria colony, we can proceed simultaneously with the bacterial identification and the antibiotic resistance gene detection.

* 100% of isolates of *A. baumannii* contains the blaOXA-51-like gene and the AmpC gene.

* 34/46 isolates possess the gene blaTEM, however, do not contain blaCTX-M and blaSHV genes.

* Combined disc test with cefotaxime/clavulanic acid/boronic acid is an excellent method to analyse ESBL phenotype.
