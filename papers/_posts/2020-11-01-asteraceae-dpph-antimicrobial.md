# Abstract

Asteraceae species were widely applied in traditional medicines in Asian countries as sources of natural antioxidants and antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to evaluate DPPH-scavenging capacities and antimicrobial activities of nine Asteraceae species collected from Southern Vietnam. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were determined by standard protocols. Essential oils from *Ageratum conyzoides*, *Helianthus annuus*, and *Artemisia vulgaris* indicated significant inhibitory effects on *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Candida* spp. Crude extracts and fractions from *Taraxacum officinale*, *Chrysanthemum morifolium*, *A. conyzoides*, and *Tagetes erecta* showed inhibitory ability on at least one testing bacterial strains including *S. aureus*, *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. In a study on clinical isolates, ethyl acetate fraction from *A. conyzoides* flower displayed the most potent effect on uropathogenic *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae* with MIC at 1.25–10 mg/ml and 5–12.5 mg/ml, respectively. DPPH-scavenging assay indicated that T. erecta extract had the lowest IC50 (17.280 μg/ml) and is 2.4 times higher than vitamin C (7.321 μg/ml). This study revealed that A. conyzoides has good potential against uropathogenic *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae*, and therefore could be applied for prophylactic treatment of urinary infection.
