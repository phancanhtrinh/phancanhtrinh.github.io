# Abstract

Recent months have seen surges of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the globe with considerable viral evolution. Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Two signature mutations of concern are E484K, which plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of variant lineage B.1.526 that contains E484K and its alarming rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and less susceptible to neutralization by convalescent plasma or vaccinee sera, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The B.1.526 lineage has now been reported from all 50 states in the United States and numerous other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York upon its emergence, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. Such transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, probably contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526. Although SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 initially outpaced B.1.1.7 in the region, its growth subsequently slowed concurrent with the rise of B.1.1.7 and ensuing variants.
