# Abstract

The pronounced skin tropism and pan-antifungal resistance traits of the fungal pathogen *Candida auris* stand out as a serious health threat. Here, we show that a carbonic sensing pathway (CSP) promotes development of resistance to amphotericin B through a reactive oxygen species (ROS) response, as well as ectopic cell wall and membrane lipid homeostasis. Mechanistically, the transcription factor Rca1 acts in cooperation with Efg1 to control the expression and activity of the carbonic anhydrase Nce103 as a key effector component. The conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate provides a direct link to energy metabolism, facilitating colonization and growth on skin tissues. Native mouse and human skin models unequivocally show that the CSP is essential for maintaining skin tropism as well as fungal fitness. Curiously, upon ablation of Rca1 and Efg1, *C. auris* debilitates efficient growth on native skin. Collectively, our findings highlight critical roles of the CSP in C. auris skin tropism and antifungal drug resistance. The work suggests therapeutic options for disrupting skin colonization and thus preventing infections.
