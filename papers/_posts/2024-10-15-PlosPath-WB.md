# Abstract

Intraspecies variations that affect pathogenicity and antifungal resistance traits pose a serious obstacle to efficient therapy of *Candida auris* infections. Recent reports indicate that mutations determine drug susceptibility and virulence. However, mutations alone cannot fully explain a bewildering variety of phenotypes in clinical isolates from known *C. auris* clades, suggesting an unprecedented complexity underlying virulence traits and antifungal resistance. Hence, we wish to discuss how phenotypic plasticity promotes morphogenetic switching and how that contributes to intraspecies variations in the human fungal pathogen *C. auris*. Further, we will also discuss how intraspecies variations and morphogenetic events can impact the progress in molecular mycology research that aims to find better treatments for *C. auris* infections. Finally, we will present our opinion as to the most relevant questions to be addressed when trying to better understand the pathophysiology of *C. auris*.
