	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Current plateau at ~30,000 cases reported per day with ~1M total confirmed cases reported</li>
		<li>With 10-15X underreporting, this is likely 300k to 450k infections per day and between 10M and 15M total infections</li>
		<li>NYC may have 30% seropositivity at this point, I'd guess ~3-5% nationally</li>
		<li>Herd immunity likely requires at least 66% recovered</li>
		<li>Infection-to-fatality ratio in general population of 0.5% to 1.0%, much of which has yet to be realized in the currently ill</li>

		<li>Facing a long period of localized flare-ups and societal responses</li>
		<li>Recommend strategies to mitigate spread while keeping economy functioning</li>

	<h3>Fundamental importance of contact tracing and quarantine of exposed contacts</h3>
	<div class="left" style="float:left;width:50%">
		<p class="smaller" style="text-align: left;">
			This is due to the large fraction of presymptomatic (and perhaps asymptomatic) transmission.
			Contact tracing of symptomatic index cases more efficient and efficacious than biweekly population testing (Kucharski et al).
			Requires <i>speed</i> (exposures alerted within 48 hours from index case developing symptoms) and <i>scale</i> (currently ~300k infections per day).

<section style="text-align: left;">
	<h3>Requirements for contact tracing at scale</h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Scale up of testing. We need to be testing to be readily available for mild cases and free to access. Testing mild cases helps adherence to isolation. Testing early in the course of illness is most beneficial.</li>
		<li>Workforce development. Models based on current workflows estimate 180k people to support tracing 30k daily confirmed cases and follow up with their contacts.</li>
		<li>Wrap around services. Voluntary self-isolation facilities. Income support for self-isolation.</li>
		<li>Digital tools to increase efficiency and efficacy of case investigation and organize efforts (possibly involving privacy-preserving proximity apps).</li>

	<h3>Reducing transmission rate reduces final epidemic size</h3>
	<img class="stretch" data-src="/images/talks/ncov_flatten_the_curve.png">
</section>

<section style="text-align: left;">
	<h3>Reduction in transmission pays dividends</h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirming 1 case in 5 and successfully quarantining 50% of their contacts would reduce $R_0$ by 10%</li>
		<li>$R_0$ of 1.5 (achieved through hygiene and social distancing) translates to 191M eventual infections</li>
		<li>$R_0$ of 1.35 (with the addition of scalable contact tracing) translates to 154M eventual infections</li>
		<li>This is roughly 18M averted symptomatic infections (assuming a 50% symptomatic rate), 180k averted deaths (assuming IFR of 0.5%) and $56B in averted direct medical costs</li>
	</ul>
