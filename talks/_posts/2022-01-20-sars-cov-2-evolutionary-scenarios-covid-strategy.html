	<h3>Omicron attack rate</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			We estimate US has seen 4.5% of the population as confirmed cases of Omicron through Jan 17, with the
			large majority accumulating after Dec 15
		</li>
		<li>
			Assuming a case detection rate of 1 in 5 infections, we have ~22.5% of the US having been infected with Omicron
		</li>
		<li>
			We're about at the peak now, assuming the same number of cases on the other side of the peak would give ~45% of the US
			infected by Omicron in the span of just over 2 months.

	<h3>Omicron likely displaces Delta, but this is not definite</h3>

<!-- Expectations for endemicity -->

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Broad expectations based on comparison with flu</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<i>R</i><sub class="even-smaller">0</sub> of Delta/Omicron is perhaps ~6 compared to
			<i>R</i><sub class="even-smaller">0</sub> of flu of ~2. At same rates of evolution and waning
			expect more COVID circulation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Before Omicron rates of evolution in SARS-CoV-2 S1 had been roughly equal to H3N2 flu.
			Omicron equivalent to 6 years of H3N2 evolution.
		</li>
		<li>
			IFR of COVID is roughly comparable to flu once you have prior immunity.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		1, 2 and 3 suggest a virus that circulates at higher levels than flu, but individual
		infections aren't much more severe in terms of mortality than H3N2 influenza.
	</p>
	<p>
		Seasonality suggests winter "COVID season", but Omicron-like events could overcome seasonality.
	</p>
</section>

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Key parameters are seasonal attack rate and IFR</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Assume seasonal attack rates of 20-30% in most years, and Omicron-like 50% in others.
		</li>
		<li>
			Assume IFR of 0.05% (compared to early pandemic IFR of 0.5%).
		</li>
		<li>
			This would give perhaps 30-50K deaths most seasons, and Omicron-like seasons with ~80K deaths in the US (but potential for IFR of 0.1% to double this).
		</li>
	</ol>
