<!--
Outline:

1. Overview of SARS-CoV-2 evolution up to this point
 - Emergence and spread of variant viruses during 2021 due primarily to mutations to spike protein that increase transmissibility culminating in Delta’s displacement of competing diversity
 - Emergence and rapid spread of Omicron emphasizing large spike divergence and large degree of immune escape (~10% VE against symptomatic infection in fully vaccinated)
 - Briefly cover Omicron origin hypotheses
2. Comparison to influenza and seasonal CoV evolution, emphasizing the rapidity of what we’ve seen so far with SARS-CoV-2 relative to flu
 - Focus just on amino acid rate
3. Discussion of immediate trends as existing genetic diversity plays out
 - We’ll see displacement of BA.1 by BA.2 over the coming ~8 weeks
 - Still potential for return of Delta viruses, which should become clear in ~April
4. Discussion of two "paths" for SARS-CoV-2 evolution going forward, where we can expect to see:
 - Continual refinements of transmissibility and continual push for small antigenic changes within BA.2
 - Potential for large leaps with further “Omicron-like” saltational emergence events
 - Given ~2 years of pandemic and observation of 1 Omicron-like event we can bracket rate of emergence, but there is substantial uncertainty
 - ie we don’t know if Omicron was a one-off event or if these jumps will be feature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution going forward
5. Likely scenarios over the next ~12 months
 - Connect scenarios to levels of circulation

<!-- 5. Likely scenarios over the next ~12 months
 - Connect scenarios to levels of circulation -->

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Likely scenarios over the next 12 months</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Evolution within Omicron BA.2 to further increase intrinsic transmission and to escape from Omicron-derived immunity. This scenario sees lower attack rates with 2022-2023 epidemic driven by drift + waning + seasonality.
		</li>
		<li>
			Another Omicron-like emergence event in which a chronic infection initiated in ~2021 incubates a new wildly divergent virus. This scenario sees high attack rates with epidemic driven by variant emergence.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
</section>

<!-- Expectations for endemicity -->

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Broad expectations of endemicity based on comparison with flu</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<i>R</i><sub class="even-smaller">0</sub> of Delta/Omicron is perhaps ~6 compared to
			<i>R</i><sub class="even-smaller">0</sub> of flu of ~2. At same rates of evolution and waning
			expect more COVID circulation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Before Omicron rates of evolution in SARS-CoV-2 S1 had been roughly equal to H3N2 flu.
			Omicron equivalent to 5 years of H3N2 evolution.
		</li>
		<li>
			Infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID is roughly comparable to flu once you have prior immunity.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		1, 2 and 3 suggest a virus that circulates at higher levels than flu, but individual
		infections aren't much more severe in terms of mortality than H3N2 influenza.
	</p>
	<p>
		Seasonality suggests winter "COVID season", but Omicron-like events could overcome seasonality.
	</p>
</section>

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Key parameters are seasonal attack rate and IFR</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Assume seasonal attack rate of 40%, with Omicron-like emergence driving 80% some years.
		</li>
		<li>
			Assume IFR of 0.05% (compared to early pandemic IFR of 0.5%), but new variant could push this higher.
		</li>
		<li>
			This would give somewhere around 60K yearly deaths at endemicity, but potential for variant emergence to push this over 100K.
		</li>
	</ol>
