I'm a Professor at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/) in the [Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/vaccine-and-infectious-disease.html) and the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs/projects/herbold-computational-biology-program.html), affiliate faculty in the [Department of Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu) and the [Department of Epidemiology](https://epi.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), and an Investigator at the [Howard Hughes Medical Institute](https://www.hhmi.org/).

My research program focuses on using viral genome sequences to understand virus evolution and to gain insight into factors driving viral outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.
Much of this work has been instantiated in the [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) platform to conduct real-time genomic epidemiology and to share results broadly.
This platform has seen substantial public health adoption to improve seasonal influenza vaccines, combat Ebola outbreaks and to understand and curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
More broadly, I've sought to progress genomic surveillance and with the [Seattle Flu Study](https://seattleflu.org/), lead the design and implementation of a next-generation infectious disease surveillance system that greatly impacted state and local response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
