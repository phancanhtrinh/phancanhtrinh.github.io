I am a Molecular and Cellular Biology graduate student in the Bedford lab. I am broadly interested in studying the process of evolution including how host/pathogen interactions sculpt genomes, how fossils of selective forces like these can be seen in sequence data, and how epistasis constrains evolutionary potential. In the Bedford lab, I have recently focused on identifying and describing adaptive evolution in coronaviruses using phylogenetic and sequenced-based methods. Before this, I studied mutations that occur when human influenza H3N2 is passaged in eggs during vaccine production, found epistatic interactions between them, and predicted the antigenic impact of these mutations.
