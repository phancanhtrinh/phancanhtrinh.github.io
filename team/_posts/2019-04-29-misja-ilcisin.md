I am a Program Manager in the Bedford Lab. I am generally interested in the how tech platforms can be leveraged to improve the health of populations, translational research, and developing interdisciplinary solutions to large-scale public health problems. My interest in these areas came about while studying for my Bachelor's degree in Public Health Science at Santa Clara University and through my experiences in community-based research and at a Myanmar-based health tech start-up. As a native of the PNW, I am excited to be at the Hutch and put these passions to work close to home.
