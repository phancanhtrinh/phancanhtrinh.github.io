I am a third-year computer science student at the University of Washington.  I was a high school summer intern when I first joined the Bedford lab in 2016 and worked on the phylogenetic analysis of [yellow fever virus evolution](/projects/yellow-fever/). Working in the lab that summer sparked my interest in computational biology. I have now returned to the lab to gain more experience in bioinformatics and be able to connect concepts I have learned in my classes to the work of biological research.
