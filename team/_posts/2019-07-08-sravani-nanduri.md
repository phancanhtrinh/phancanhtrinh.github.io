Sravani is entering her junior year at Issaquah High School. Sravani joined the lab in early 2019 and continued to work into the summer, joining the 8 week Fred Hutch High School Internship Program. Sravani's main project through the lab was creating an interactive tool that uses different embeddings of genetic sequence data via MDS, t-SNE and U-MAP to identify patterns and relationships that aren't seen in phylogenies due to recombination (with diseases such as enterovirus, bacteria, and malaria).
