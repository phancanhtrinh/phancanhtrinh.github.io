My background is in computer science and I help develop [Nextstrain](http://nextstrain.org), [Auspice](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice), and help write Nextstrain documentation. I came to the lab from [Erick Matsen's group](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/) where I built [Olmsted](http://www.olmstedviz.org/) from a fork of Auspice. Olmsted is an open source tool for visualizing B-cell repertoire and clonal lineage data.
