I have been studying clinical fungal infections for 4 years in Vietnam before starting research in fungal pathogenesis and drug-resistance mechanisms in Vienna. My PhD project focuses on *Candida auris*, an emerging human fungal pathogen causing invasive infections in immunosuppressed patients with a high rate of pan-antifungal drug resistance.  

I apply integrated omics datasets (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, metabolomics) and tools of reverse genetics (targeted gene disruption, insertions of reporter genes) to 
* dissect dynamics of regulatory networks and chromatin alterations in morphogenetic switching, host-fungal interaction, and drug response; 
* identify virulence factors and antifungal drug resistance genes. 

The long-term goal is discovering the major mechanisms of virulence and drug resistance of *C. auris* to develop better therapeutic strategies.
